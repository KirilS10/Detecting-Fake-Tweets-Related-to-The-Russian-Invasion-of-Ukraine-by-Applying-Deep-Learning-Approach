# Detecting-Fake-Tweets-Related-to-The-Russian-Invasion-of-Ukraine-by-Applying-Deep-Learning-Approach

In the technological project, the fake tweets (content) task was approached by applying Deep Learning approach. The projectâ€™s objective was to build Deep Learning models that are able to identify whether anything related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 on Twitter.The main goal of this project was to build Deep Learning models that would automatically classify tweets related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 on Twitter with high accuracy. The developing process was focused on Deep Learning algorithms that are based on the following features: Sentence segmentation, Word tokenization, Tagging parts of speech, Stop words, etc.

# Research Question
This technological project proposes the research question of what accuracy can be reached in detecting fake tweets related to Russian invasion of Ukraine by applying developed the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks models. Specifically, the aim of this project is to develop and train Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks models by using publicly available datasets with related tweets. Additional question of the project is to identify the most accurate model that is effective in predicting fake tweets while also minimising the training time.
